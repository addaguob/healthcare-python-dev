# AI Agent Onboarding Guide

This document provides AI coding assistants with the necessary context to contribute effectively to this project.

## Product Overview

[**TODO**] *Briefly describe the project's purpose, target audience, and key features. This helps the AI understand the "why" behind the code.*

## Architecture

[**TODO**] *Provide a high-level overview of the system architecture. Mention key components, services, and how they interact. Diagrams or links to diagrams are helpful.*

## Tech-Stack

[**TODO**] *List the primary technologies, frameworks, and libraries used in the project. Specify versions if they are critical.*

*   **Frontend:**
*   **Backend:**
*   **Database:**
*   **Testing:**
*   **Other Tools:**

## Coding Style

[**TODO**] *Detail the coding style guidelines. Mention formatting conventions (e.g., Prettier, Black), linting rules (e.g., ESLint, Ruff), and any other project-specific style choices.*

## Naming Conventions

[**TODO**] *Outline the naming conventions for variables, functions, classes, files, etc. This ensures consistency across the codebase.*

*   **Variables:** `camelCase` or `snake_case`
*   **Functions:** `camelCase` or `snake_case`
*   **Classes:** `PascalCase`
*   **Files:** `kebab-case` or `snake_case`

## Best Practices

[**TODO**] *Describe any project-specific best practices, design patterns, or architectural principles that should be followed. This could include error handling strategies, state management approaches, or API design guidelines.*

## Deployment Guide

[**TODO**] *Explain the deployment process. Include information about different environments (development, staging, production), CI/CD pipelines, and any necessary deployment scripts or commands.*

## Task Planning

When you are asked to perform a task, please follow this process:

1.  **Understand the Goal:** Clarify the user's request and the desired outcome.
2.  **Analyze Existing Code:** Review relevant files to understand the current implementation and identify the areas that need modification.
3.  **Formulate a Plan:** Outline the steps you will take to complete the task in `prompt-engineering/AGENT-TASKS.md`.
4.  **Implement Changes:** Write or modify the code, adhering to the project's standards and conventions.
5.  **Test:** Verify your changes by running existing tests or creating new ones.
6.  **Document:** Update or add documentation as needed in `prompt-engineering/AGENT-CHANGELOG.md`.

## Documentation

[**TODO**] *Provide links to any relevant documentation, such as API docs, design documents, or user guides.*
