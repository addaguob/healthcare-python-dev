# Debug and Fix Error

## Description
Systematically debug and fix errors by reflecting on possible sources, identifying most likely causes, and adding validation logs before implementing fixes.

## Usage
Use this command when encountering bugs or errors that need systematic troubleshooting.

## Prompt
Reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem, distill those down to 1-2 most likely sources, and then add logs to validate your assumptions before we move onto implementing the actual code fix

## Example
When you encounter an error in the healthcare application:
1. List 5-7 potential causes (database connection, validation, UI state, etc.)
2. Narrow down to the 1-2 most likely causes based on error context
3. Add strategic logging/debugging to validate assumptions
4. Only then implement the actual fix

This systematic approach prevents hasty fixes that might introduce new bugs.
